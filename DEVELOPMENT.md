## Create a new chart

The class Table is a example of "chart".

When you create a new class of chart, you have to add it in :

* Check it, if your chart exists and works via the SPARQL editor of tutorial.

Finally, you can create a new tutorial in the folder tutorial(duplicate the example of class Table) and change the file
tutorials.json.

## Create a new namespace

The project simulate the concept of namespace because there are again problems in typescript.

if you want create a new namespace, you can create a new folder with the same name and in the root add a file where you
export your new classes. See example :  file sgvizler.ts and sgvizler/namespace.ts
